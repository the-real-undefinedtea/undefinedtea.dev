              For now at least... I have been really fed up with this machine for so many reasons, none of witch are really its fault. The machine itself is well built, has a great form factor and I love the keyboard. The real issue is that desktop linux is just not usable - and believe me, I have tried.

            <Uses topic="Rac3 Mechanical Keyboard">
              No real surprise here I assume, but like most people who spend most of their waking moments in front of a computer, I can not stand anything but a mechanical keyboard. I have had this Rac3 keyboard for over 5 years now, and I love everything about it. It feels solid.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="MX Master 3">
              I do make an effort to stay on the keyboard as much as possible, but once in a while I just can not. The MX Master 3 is a ratehr standard option as far as peripherals go I think. But as they say: if it ain't broke, do not fix it.

            <Uses topic="Brio 4k">
              Since the laptop is mostly nearly stowed away to the side, an external camera is required. Also, can I just say that I do not understand how or why a built-in camera today has the resolution of a potato.

              This re-commissioned built from 2015 is the most essential item I own. It provides my entire home lab (which is quite extensive) and I have no idea what I would do without it. The detail of this machine which I call elrond deserves more than just a mention here, so there will be a full length article on this soon.

              Not great but not terrible is how I would describe this one. It is really just a place to provide an audio interface to all that fancy stuff listed below.

            <Uses topic="Rode Procaster / Rode PSA1 & Rode SM6">
              The aim is to one day host a podcast. In the meanwhile I also gladly use this microphone to stream on twitch.

            <Uses topic="Adam Audio T5V">
              Granted I rarely listen to anything without headphones, but when I do I like the sound to be good. These speakers sound great to me and are affordable.
            </Uses>
            <Uses topic="Bose QC35">
              The noisecancelation on these is fantastic and to me they are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The time to go to the Bose 700 is probably near.

              A year or so ago I made peace with the fact that a customised vim environment is probably not the most effective means for me anymore when it comes to writing code. I do still use vim for some tasks, but the daily driver now is VS Code. As with the server, this too deserves a bit more explenation, so there will be a full length article on this soon.

              Getting (and staying) organised is an endless quest it seems. That is until I found notion. Notion is kind of everything and nothing, so the best way to learn about it is just by using it.

            <Uses topic="Todoist">
              It was the fall of 2017 when I went on a youtube spree that lead me to people who spent considerable time to configure todoist to run their life. Naturally I followed along, and whilst I found methods that work for me over the years, I have not looked back since.
