I had lunch with a fantastic person today and made a promise to publish this project before the end of the day. I inteded to keep that promise, and here we are.

Now all that is left to do is to actually make everything work, create all the content and keep on creating content. In other words - the difficult part is done.
Anyhow, I am tired. Goodnight.
